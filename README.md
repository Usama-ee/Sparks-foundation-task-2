This is the task of K-means clustering which is the sub class of partional clustering
where we find clusters of data. The data which show same element gathers and we marked them as cluster.
we did go further in the algorithms of K-means. But for small introduction we initial take a centroid
and use mms distance or sum of square distance to measure the short distance between the point in the clusters 
on the bases of that K-Means run
