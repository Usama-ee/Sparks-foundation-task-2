This is the task of K-means clustering which is the sub class of partional clustering
where we find clusters of data. The data which show same element gathers and we marked them as cluster.
we didn't go further in the algorithm of K-means. But for small introduction we initialy take a centroid
and measure mms distance or sum of square distance to measure the short distance between the points in the clusters 
on that bases algorithm of K-Means run.
